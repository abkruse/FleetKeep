# FleetKeep

##Currently Under Construction

This vehicle fleet management application is designed to ease the flow of data from drivers to supervisors and mechanics for any organization that has a vehicle fleet. Designed with the delivery company in mind, this is an application that can grow for valet service or any industry with a collection of vehicles to track.

FleetKeep is focused on allowing a driver or other employee to login and easily submit vehicle condition and any noticeable damage at the beginning of the shift. A supervisor can see realtime data on their fleet via the supervisor dashboard and forward necessary work on to mechanics. 

###FleetKeep is being built:
- AngularJS
