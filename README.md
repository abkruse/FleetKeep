# FleetKeep

This vehicle fleet management application is designed to ease the flow of data from drivers to supervisors and mechanics for any organization that has a vehicle fleet. Designed with the delivery company in mind, this is an application that can grow for valet service or any industry with a collection of vehicles to track.

FleetKeep is focused on allowing a driver or other employee to login and easily submit vehicle condition and any noticeable damage at the beginning of the shift. A supervisor can see realtime data on their fleet via the supervisor dashboard and forward necessary work on to mechanics.

###FleetKeep is built with:
- AngularJS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- SignaturePad
- Highcharts
- Knex.js
